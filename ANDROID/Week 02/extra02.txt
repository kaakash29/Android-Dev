If you're interested in installing an application from the command line, you need to take a few extra steps. In particular, in Eclipse, click on File > Export > Export > Export Android Application. From there you will need to follow a dialog that involves signing the .apk file. Eclipse normally puts the debug.keystore in the ~/.android directory. See Signing in Debug Mode (http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html) for further explanation and the various passwords you'll need. Once the dialog completes, you can issue the adb install command to install the .apk file on your device.
